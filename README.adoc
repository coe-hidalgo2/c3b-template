[.lead]
This repository serves as the template used by GitHub Classroom to generate personalized development environments for HPC training sessions. It is pre-configured with the tools and libraries needed for MPI application development and testing.

== Overview

The **c3b-template** repository is designed to:

* Provide every trainee with an identical, reproducible development setup.
* Facilitate hands-on exercises in MPI application development.
* Include essential software such as:
** Ubuntu 24.04 as the base environment
** MPI libraries (e.g., OpenMPI)
** CMake, Ninja, and G++ for building applications
** Python3 and associated development tools
** Boost libraries for testing and serialization

== Getting Started

=== For Trainees  

When you accept an assignment via GitHub Classroom, a personalized repository is created based on this template. 
Then:

1. **Open Your Codespace:**  
   Click the **Code** button in your repository and choose **Open with Codespaces**. Your development environment will be automatically set up with all required tools.
2. **Compile and Test the Code:**  
   Follow the instructions below to compile and run tests.

=== For Instructors

Uniform Environment::  Use this template to ensure all trainees receive a consistent environment.
Customization::  Modify the repository as needed to include additional examples or exercises tailored to your training session.
Integration:: GitHub Classroom automates repository creation from this template, simplifying distribution and management.

== Building and Testing the Code

This repository uses CMake with preset configurations for building and testing the MPI application.

=== Compiling the Code

To compile the code locally, follow these steps:

[source,shell]
----
# Configure the build system using CMake presets
cmake --preset default

# Build the project using CMake presets
cmake --build --preset default
----

=== Running the Tests

After building the code, you can run the tests to verify that everything is working correctly:

[source,shell]
----
# Run tests using CTest with the preset configuration
ctest --preset default
----

The testing framework integrated in this repository ensures that the MPI application behaves as expected.
